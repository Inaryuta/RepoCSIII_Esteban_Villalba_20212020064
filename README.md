# Computer Science III - Theory of Computation Repository

This repository contains all the work and assignments completed throughout the semester for the **Computer Science III** course. It includes formal exercises, derivations, grammars, and automata design practices to strengthen the understanding of theoretical foundations in computation.

## Contents
- **Workshops**: Practical workshops on regular expressions, finite-state machines, and context-free grammars.
- **Derivation Trees**: Step-by-step derivations from defined grammars.
- **Automata and Grammars**: Construction of deterministic finite automata (DFAs) and context-free grammars (CFGs).
- **Regular Expressions**: Language definitions and conversions from automata.
- **Turing Machine Concepts** (if applicable in future assignments).

## Course Overview
This course covers:
- Design and analysis of **finite-state machines** (FSMs).
- Formal construction and interpretation of **regular expressions**.
- Development and application of **context-free grammars** (CFGs).
- Construction of **derivation trees** and parsing strategies.
- Theoretical foundations leading toward **Turing machines** and computation limits.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate through the folders to review and explore each project and assignment.
3. Refer to the README files within each folder for detailed explanations and derivations.
